Taddapp is an Android application to add text to images.
It's very easy to use and also very fast
(you can open, edit and share an image
with less than 10 clicks and 30 seconds).
What is different and innovative from the other apps is that this one
has the fonts already setup,
so the user doesn't have to configure them
(that makes the app easier and faster too).
Furthermore, the fonts are beauty and carefully designed and
there are a lot of them.
Thus, the app can be used in a very different scenarios,
image types and styles, there are infinite combinations.

You can see a lot of samples in our
[Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/taddapp/).
The application can be downloaded from our small
[landing page](http://taddapp.com)
or directly from the
[Google Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taddapp).

After this brief introduction,
I'm going to summarize the project history from inside:

The idea was born a couple of years ago and its purpose was to
develop the project as an experiment to learn,
before starting something bigger.
We were just a designer (David Mundo) and me.
The idea was simple but we give it an innovative
touch with the fonts setup
(apart from the usability and agility distinctions).

We started developing the product and
launched a prototype,
which the user seemed to like.
Nevertheless, after a few months the statistics became flat.
We used to work on Taddapp in our free time so
after releasing a few bug-fixing updates we had to
put the project aside.

A year later, people was still using the app
so we decided to get back to work.
We didn't want to implement new features
but to improve what I've done
by adding more and better fonts, fixing some errors
and improving the generated image quality.
Finally, in September 2015, we launched Taddapp 2.0,
which was also welcomed by the users
and still used today
(around 5k unique users per month).

The main goal of the project was learn and
I can say we have achieve it.
Not only about development and design stuff,
but about creativity, UX, product, user testing,
lean project management, analytics, release,
community management, marketing...

Although it is not a really successful project,
we have enjoyed the process, we like the product and
the most important thing: we use it and we are glad of it!
