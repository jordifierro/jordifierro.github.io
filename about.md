Hi! I'm a software engineer living in Barcelona. I've some experience with Android development and mobile architecture and now I'm working as freelance on my own projects. [Taddapp](http://taddapp.com) is one of them. I'm also a green rails backend developer.

My other passion is algorithmics. I've been learning and teaching and also participating in a few online contests at [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/jfm/) and [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/jfm), using c++. Now I keep reading and practicing whenever I can.

Also describes me my devotion for critical thinking, pragmatic programming, lean methodologies, software architecture, create my own projects and learn about almost all, not necessarily in that order.

This blog aims to improve my programming and communication skills, my written english (which is not my mother tongue, as you can see), strengthen what I learn... I would be happy if some post can be of any help. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any comment, whether good or bad!
