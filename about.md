Hi! I'm a software engineer living in Barcelona.
I develop mobile applications (backend: python with Django, Android: kotlin & java, iOS: swift)
focusing on good architecture and clean code.

My other passion is algorithmics.
I've been learning and teaching and also participating in online contests
such as [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/jfm/)
and [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/jfm), using c++.
 Now I keep reading and [practicing](https://github.com/jordifierro/uva)
 whenever I can.

It also defines me my devotion for critical thinking, pragmatic programming,
lean methodologies, software architecture, bootstrapping
and learning about almost all, not necessarily in that order.

This blog aims to improve my programming and communication skills,
my written english, strengthen what I learn and contribute to the community...
I would be happy if that can be of any help to other developers.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any comment, whether good or bad!
